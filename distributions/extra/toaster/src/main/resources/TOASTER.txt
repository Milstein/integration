To request a toast, do the equivalent of:

curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/yang.operation+json" -XPOST \
    http://localhost:8080/restconf/operations/toaster:make-toast -d \
    '{
         "input" : {
              "toasterDoneness" : 10,
              "toasterToastType" : "white-bread"
          }
    }'

Note that the darker the toast, the longer it takes to make.

You can view the toaster status over by examining

http://localhost:8080/restconf/operational/toaster:toaster/

Happy toasting! :)
